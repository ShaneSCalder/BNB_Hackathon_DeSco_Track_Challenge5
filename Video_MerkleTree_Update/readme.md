# Video Merkle Tree Generator

This Go application demonstrates the construction of a Merkle tree from a video file. It chunks the video into fixed-size pieces, builds a Merkle tree from these chunks, calculates the Merkle root, and outputs both the Merkle root and a visual representation of the entire Merkle tree.

## Features

- **Video Chunking**: Splits a video file into manageable chunks.
- **Merkle Tree Construction**: Builds a Merkle tree from the video chunks.
- **Merkle Root Output**: Saves the Merkle root to `data/merkleroot.txt`.
- **Tree Representation**: Generates a textual representation of the Merkle tree in `data/merkletree.txt`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed on your system. This project is compatible with Go 1.15 and newer versions.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

### Usage

To run the program, execute the following command from the root of the project directory:

bash
go run cmd/main.go


## Usage

The program expects a video file named `TestVideo.mp4` in the `data` directory by default.
Ensure this file exists, or modify the `videoPath` variable in `cmd/main.go` to point to the location of your video file.

## Outputs

After running, the program generates two files in the `data` directory:

- `merkleroot.txt`: Contains the Merkle root of the constructed tree.
- `merkletree.txt`: Provides a visual representation of the Merkle tree.

## Compiling for Use in Web Applications

After adjusting the Go program according to your needs, you can compile it to a binary executable for various platforms.
This compiled version can then be integrated into web applications, enabling server-side processing or even client-side use via WebAssembly (depending on the use case and compilation target).

### Compiling the Go Program

To compile the program for your current platform, run:

bash
go build -o merkletree cmd/main.go


This command will create an executable file named `merkletree` (or `merkletree.exe` on Windows) that can be used directly from the command line, integrated into Visual Studio Code tasks, or called from other programs and web applications.

### Integration with Other Technologies

Once compiled into an executable, the Go program can be utilized within a variety of programming and scripting environments. This cross-language compatibility opens up numerous possibilities for integrating advanced Go functionalities into broader applications and systems.

- **In Command Line Scripts**: Directly execute the binary from batch scripts (`.bat`) on Windows or shell scripts (`.sh`) on Unix-like systems.
- **Within Visual Studio Code**: Use tasks or the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code to run the executable as part of your development workflow.
- **With Node.js**: Use the `child_process` module to spawn the executable from a Node.js application, allowing for integration into web servers or backend services.
- **In Python**: Utilize the `subprocess` module to call the executable for processing video files, useful in data analysis or media processing applications.
- **From Web Applications**: For server-side operations in web applications, execute the binary for tasks like video processing or generating Merkle trees for uploaded files.

### Example: Calling from Node.js

Here's a quick example of how you might call the compiled executable from a Node.js application using the `child_process` module:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('./merkletree data/TestVideo.mp4', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
        console.error(`Execution error: ${error}`);
        return;
    }
    console.log(`Merkle Root: ${stdout}`);
});
```

This integration flexibility makes the compiled Go program a versatile tool that can be deployed in a wide range of application scenarios, enhancing both development efficiency and application capabilities.
