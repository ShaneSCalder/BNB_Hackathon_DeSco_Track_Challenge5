# Merkle Tree Implementation in Go

This Go package provides a robust implementation of a Merkle tree, a fundamental data structure in cryptography and blockchain technology. It's designed to efficiently and securely verify the content of large data sets, like video files, by generating a Merkle root and proofs for data chunks.

## Features

- **Merkle Node and Tree Structures**: Defines the basic components of a Merkle tree, including nodes with left and right children and data storage capabilities.
- **Dynamic Chunking**: Dynamically calculates chunk sizes for data (e.g., video files) to optimize the tree construction process based on the data size.
- **Merkle Root Generation**: Constructs a Merkle tree from given data bytes and calculates the Merkle root, offering a compact representation of the data's integrity.
- **Proof Generation**: Provides the ability to generate Merkle proofs for specific data chunks, enabling the verification of data integrity without requiring the entire dataset.
- **File Operations**: Includes functionality to write the Merkle root and proofs to files, facilitating easy storage and sharing of verification data.

## Usage

To use this package, ensure your Go environment is set up and replace `"your_module_path/merkletree"` in the import statement with the actual path to this package. The main functionalities include creating a Merkle tree from a data slice, generating a Merkle root, and producing proofs for data chunks.

Example usage can be seen in `main.go`, where a video file is read into memory, a Merkle tree is constructed from it, and both the Merkle root and a proof for a specific chunk are generated and saved to files.

### Creating a Merkle Tree and Generating Proofs

```go
videoBytes, _ := os.ReadFile("your_video.mp4") // Read your video file
mt := merkletree.NewMerkleTree(videoBytes) // Create Merkle tree
merkleRoot := mt.GetRoot() // Get Merkle root
proof := mt.GenerateProof(3) // Generate proof for the 3rd chunk
```

### Writing Merkle Root and Proof to Files

```go
merkletree.WriteRootToFile(merkleRoot, "merkle_root.txt") // Save Merkle root
merkletree.WriteProofToFile(proof, "merkle_proof.txt") // Save Merkle proof
```

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

- **Video Size Considerations**: Currently optimized for smaller video files. Large files may require chunking or lead to performance issues.
- **Future Support for Larger Files**: We are planning to extend the implementation to more efficiently handle larger files and provide enhanced verification mechanisms.
