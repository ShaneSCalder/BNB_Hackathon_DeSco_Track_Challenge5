# Video Merkle Tree Generator

This Go program demonstrates the process of generating a Merkle tree from a video file, extracting the Merkle root, and creating a Merkle proof for a specific chunk of the video data. It uses the `merkletree` package to manage Merkle tree operations, including tree creation, root retrieval, and proof generation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your system.
- A video file named `your_video.mp4` in the same directory as the program.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.go` file to your local machine.
2. Ensure the `merkletree` package is correctly imported in `main.go`. Replace `"your_module_path/merkletree"` with the actual path to your `merkletree` package.

### Usage

1. Place your target video file in the same directory as the `main.go` file and rename it to `your_video.mp4`, or update the file path in the source code to match your video file's location and name.
2. Run the program using the command:

    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

3. Upon successful execution, the program will generate two files:
    - `merkle_root.txt`: Contains the Merkle root of the video file.
    - `merkle_proof.txt`: Contains the Merkle proof for a specified chunk index within the video data.

## How It Works

The program performs the following steps:

1. Reads the specified MP4 video file into memory.
2. Creates a Merkle tree from the video data.
3. Extracts the Merkle root from the tree and writes it to `merkle_root.txt`.
4. Generates a Merkle proof for a specified chunk index of the video data and writes this proof to `merkle_proof.txt`.

The generated Merkle root and proof provide a cryptographic means to verify the integrity and authenticity of the video file or its specific parts.

## Configuration

To generate a Merkle proof for a different chunk index or use a different video file, modify the `chunkIndex` variable and the video file path in `main.go` accordingly.

## Video Size Considerations

### Limitations on Video Size

This program is optimized for processing smaller video files. Due to memory constraints and the computational overhead associated with generating a Merkle tree, attempting to process larger video files may result in errors or excessive processing times.

### Recommendations for Large Videos

- **Chunking Large Videos**: For larger video files, consider dividing the video into smaller chunks before processing. This can help manage memory usage and computational demands more effectively.
- **Adjusting the Program**: Modifying the program to read and process the video file in segments, rather than loading the entire file into memory at once, can also mitigate issues related to large video files.

### Error Handling for Large Files

If you encounter errors or performance issues when processing large videos, consider the following strategies:

- **Increase System Resources**: Ensure sufficient memory and processing power are available to handle the computational load.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling in the program to catch and manage issues related to file size limits, memory allocation, and processing timeouts.

### Future Enhancements

Future versions of this program may include optimizations and enhancements to support larger video files more efficiently. Contributions and suggestions for improving video processing capabilities are welcome.

## Future Plans for Larger File Support

### Expanding Capability

We recognize the importance of supporting larger video files for comprehensive content verification and integrity management. Our team is actively researching and developing solutions to extend the current capabilities of this program, enabling it to handle larger files more efficiently without compromising performance.

### Upcoming Enhancements

- **Streamlined Chunk Processing**: We aim to implement a more efficient chunk-based processing system that allows for the handling of video files of virtually any size by processing segments of the file sequentially rather than loading the entire file into memory.
- **Parallel Processing**: Exploring parallel processing techniques to improve the speed and efficiency of Merkle tree generation for large video files.
- **Optimized Memory Management**: Enhancements in memory usage patterns to support the processing of large files on systems with limited resources.

### Collaboration and Contributions

The journey to support larger files is an ongoing process, and we welcome collaboration from the developer community. If you have insights, optimizations, or techniques that could contribute to this effort, we encourage you to share them with us. Together, we can build a robust solution that serves a wider range of use cases and file sizes.

### Stay Updated

Keep an eye on our project repository for updates, releases, and announcements regarding new capabilities and improvements. Our goal is to ensure that our solution meets the evolving needs of content creators, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts who require reliable and scalable content verification tools.


## Compilation and Deployment Options

### Creating Executable Files

Our Go program can be compiled into executable files for various operating systems, ensuring it runs efficiently and consistently across different platforms.

#### Compiling for Windows, macOS, and Linux

- **Windows**:
  ```sh
  GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o VideoMerkleTree.exe main.go
  ```
- **macOS**:
  ```sh
  GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o VideoMerkleTree main.go
  ```
- **Linux**:
  ```sh
  GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o VideoMerkleTree main.go
  ```

Replace `main.go` with the path to your Go source file if it's located in a different directory. The resulting executable (`VideoMerkleTree` or `VideoMerkleTree.exe` for Windows) can be run directly on the respective operating system without needing a Go environment set up.

#### Functionality Consistency

The compiled executable will function identically across all platforms, provided the input video file is accessible to the executable. This ensures a seamless and consistent user experience, regardless of the operating system.

### Serving Through a Web Server

Alternatively, the program's functionality can be exposed through a web server, enabling users to upload video files and receive Merkle roots and proofs via a web interface. This approach broadens accessibility and simplifies use, especially for those less familiar with command-line operations.

#### Implementation Notes

- A simple web server can be implemented in Go, utilizing packages such as `net/http` to handle file uploads and respond with generated Merkle roots and proofs.
- Ensure proper security measures are in place to safely handle file uploads and serve responses.

#### Example Web Server Advantages

- **Accessibility**: Makes the program accessible from any device with a web browser, without requiring local installation.
- **User-Friendly**: Provides a graphical interface for interactions, enhancing ease of use.
- **Consistent Functionality**: The core functionality remains the same, with the web server acting as a convenient interface for the underlying Go program.

### Future Enhancements

We plan to explore and implement additional features for the web server option, including progress indicators for processing, enhanced security features, and support for larger files. Stay tuned for updates and new releases.
